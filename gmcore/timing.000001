GPTL version info: 8.1.1

Autoprofiling capability was enabled with backtrace
Underlying timing routine was gettimeofday.
GPTLget_overhead: using hash entry 34=calc_coriolis for getentry estimate
Total overhead of 1 GPTL start or GPTLstop call=1.25e-07 seconds
Components are as follows:
Fortran layer:             0.0e+00 =   0.0% of total
Get thread number:         1.9e-08 =  15.2% of total
Generate hash index:       1.8e-08 =  14.4% of total
Find hashtable entry:      2.4e-08 =  19.2% of total
Underlying timing routine: 6.1e-08 =  48.8% of total
Misc start/stop functions: 3.0e-09 =   2.4% of total

Overhead of backtrace (invoked once per auto-instrumented start entry)=6.893e-06 seconds
NOTE: If GPTL is called from C not Fortran, the 'Fortran layer' overhead is zero
NOTE: For calls to GPTLstart_handle()/GPTLstop_handle(), the 'Generate hash index' overhead is zero
NOTE: For auto-instrumented calls, the cost of generating the hash index plus finding
      the hashtable entry is 0.0e+00 not the 4.2e-08 portion taken by GPTLstart
NOTE: Each hash collision roughly doubles the 'Find hashtable entry' cost of that timer

If overhead stats are printed, they are the columns labeled self_OH and parent_OH
self_OH is estimated as 2X the Fortran layer cost (start+stop) plust the cost of 
a single call to the underlying timing routine.
parent_OH is the overhead for the named timer which is subsumed into its parent.
It is estimated as the cost of a single GPTLstart()/GPTLstop() pair.
Print method was most_frequent.

If a AVG_MPI_BYTES field is present, it is an estimate of the per-call
average number of bytes handled by that process.
If timers beginning with sync_ are present, it means MPI synchronization was turned on.

If a '%_of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
If a 'e6_per_sec' field is present, it is in millions of PAPI counts per sec.

A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the values
printed are for all calls. Multiple parent stats appear later in the file in the
section titled 'Multiple parent info'
A '!' in column 1 means the timer is currently ON and the printed timings are only
valid as of the previous GPTLstop. '!' overrides '*' if the region had multiple
parents and was currently ON.
